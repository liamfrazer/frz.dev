# CS50X - Week 0 Notes
---

* As simple as input > output
* Computers can only understand 1s and 0s
* A = 65 = 01000001
* HI! = 01001000 01001001 00100001
* A byte is 8 bits and can count to 255 (256 including 0)
* Unicode is a mapping of many more numbers compared to ASCII
* If you have 16 bits, you can represent up to 16,000 letters
* If you have 32 bits, you can represent up to 4 billion letters

* algorithm = step by step instructions to solve a problem
* Programming is harnessing intuition and ideas and learning how to express them through programming languages


## pseudocode
```
1 Pick up phone book
2 Open to middle of phone book
3 Look at page
4 If person is on page
	5 Call person
6 Else if person is earlier in book
	7 Open to middle of left half of book
	8 Go back to line 3
9 Else if person is later in book
	10 Open to middle of right half of book
	11 Go back to line 3
12 Else
	13 Quit
```

* Functions
	* Actions or verbs that solve a smaller problem
	* Translated in code to functions
* Conditionals
	* Things you do conditionally depending on the answer to some question
* Boolean Expressions
	* Simple have Yes/No true/false answers
* Loops
	* Some kind of cycle to do something again and again
	* Won't need a 1000 line program, could use a 13 line program to get to the last step using repeats/loops

## Scratch
* Will allow me to explore programming functionality without the confusion
* Sprites = Characters
* Scratch uses a co-ordinate system to place a sprite on the screen


### Abstraction
* Simplifying the feature
* Easier to design
* Easier to understand and read
*
