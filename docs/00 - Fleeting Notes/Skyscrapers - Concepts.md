# Concepts

- Battle royal style game
- Everyone flies in from a horizontal angle
- When hitting the building, the world is suddenly flipped back to normal
- There are 100s of floors where everyone can land on
- An end zone/floor is picked for the final zone
- Each floor could be slowly gassed towards the last floor or radiation to keep the gameplay moving
- Loot drops throughout each floor + people fighting if landing close to each other
- API to track the game through the website
- Collect intel to find out where the next zone is?
- Gravity boots to jump back out the window for extra movement?
- Inception styled gameplay where the corridors are moving?
- 1vs 1 game mode, 1 level only
- Co-op styled game mode - defending a certain room?
- Review bans and upvote ban style/concept similar to CSGO
- All stats are API'd, every single stat tracked and viewable via a website
- Battlefield old style web version for spectating?
- Leaderboards for important stats
- Killcams?

* The whole skyscrapper could be controlled by a computer or be inside a computer, this would be a method of cutting off zones and creating vacuums and would be logical 

* Ziplines between towers that can be destroyed


*  Destructible buildings that could take the whole building down?
* MOH styled gunplay, bending round corners + doors
* Investigate Voxel UE5, 
* API that tracks everything with a React panel
* K/D per weapon can be tracked as well


	NPCs that can destroy in game environments and react to closed doors and sabatage traps
	NPCS that can sabotage stuff like windows to let gas in, or space windows to evacuate the ship etc
