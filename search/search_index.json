skyscraper First person shooter Floors are slowly cut off until a final floor is available Floors are cut off either with radiation/gas The environment is impacted by the player (e.g smashed windows/grenades/bullets) Players can be cut off by environmental damage, but can choose the options of windows to get to the next floor When players land for the first time, their impacts can be seen on the walls/smashed windows Whichever person/team are the last in the game win Players are launched horizontally at the building, choose a floor while flying in, then smash through the windows on that floor Players spawn in with no items and have to loot up by exploring the floor they're on Players can jump back out the windows, but limited to a certain timeframe to limited how many floors they can move Players can land outside the building, but again are limited to how long they can last outside Map is non-digital / Lock off floors with no oxygen like a server room Possible oxygen
